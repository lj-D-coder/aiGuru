        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>
    </header>

    <section class="privacy-section">
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Email:</strong> We collect your email address to create and manage your QueScan account. We do not share your email with third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Hardware Access:</strong> QueScan requires access to your device's camera and microphone to scan questions from textbooks. This access is used solely for the intended functionality of the app.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            We use your email address to communicate with you regarding your account, provide important updates, and respond to your inquiries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Camera and microphone access are used exclusively for the scanning feature of the app. Images and audio captured are processed locally on your device and are not stored on our servers.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your email address to outside parties. Your scanned images and audio are not shared with third parties unless required by law or to comply with legal processes.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Security</h2>
        <p>
            We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. This includes encryption, secure connections, and access controls. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to note that while we take steps to protect your information, the security of your data also depends on you. Please keep your login credentials confidential, and let us know immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
            We retain your email address for as long as your QueScan account is active. If you choose to delete your account, your email address will be permanently removed from our records. Scanned images and audio are processed in real-time and are not stored on our servers.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting on the website. We encourage you to review this page periodically for the latest information on our privacy practices.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
